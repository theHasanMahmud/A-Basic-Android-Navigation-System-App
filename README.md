## 🧭 Project Structure
```
assignment_app/
├── lib/
│   └── main.dart             # All Cupertino screens & controllers
├── assets/
│   └── audio/sample.wav      # Offline-friendly audio demo asset
├── ios/, android/, web/      # Platform scaffolding generated by Flutter
└── test/                     # Widget test entry point
```

## 🔧 Configuration
- No extra secrets required; all media endpoints are public.
- Battery features require a real device or emulator with battery APIs enabled.
- Audio playback uses a bundled asset so it works without network access.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.9 or newer (`flutter --version`)
- Xcode / Android Studio toolchains for your target platforms
- A connected device or simulator

### Installation
```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd assignment_app
flutter pub get
```

### Run Targets
```bash
# Android or iOS (select from the device list)
flutter run

# Web preview (Chrome)
flutter run -d chrome
```

> The video player requires an active network connection the first time it buffers the remote MP4.
